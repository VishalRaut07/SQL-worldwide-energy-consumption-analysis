# 🌍 Worldwide Energy Consumption Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analytics solution analyzing worldwide energy consumption patterns. The workflow includes data cleaning using Python, analytical querying using SQL, and interactive visualization using Power BI to generate business-ready insights.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Analyze global energy consumption trends across countries and years
- Identify top energy-consuming countries
- Compare renewable vs non-renewable energy usage
- Support policy and sustainability decision-making
- Demonstrate real-world data analyst workflow

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset Details
**Source:** Worldwide Energy Consumption Dataset  
**Format:** CSV  
**Key Columns:** Country, Year, Energy Consumption, Energy Type, Population, GDP (if applicable)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)
- Handled missing and null values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized column names
- Converted data types
- Filtered invalid records
- Prepared analysis-ready dataset

## 🧮 SQL Analysis
Key SQL queries include:
- Top energy-consuming countries
- Year-wise global energy trends
- Renewable vs non-renewable comparison
- Country-level energy growth patterns
- Aggregations, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CTEs

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
- Global energy consumption trends
- Country-wise comparison
- Renewable vs non-renewable share
- KPI cards for total consumption
- Interactive slicers (Country, Year, Energy Type)

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Energy consumption has increased steadily over time
- A small number of countries contribute to the majority of global energy usage
- Renewable energy adoption is increasing but still lags behind fossil fuels
- Economic growth correlates with higher energy consumption

## ⚠ Challenges
- Large dataset handling
- Missing historical data
- Data type inconsistencies
- Optimizing SQL queries for performance
- Designing meaningful Power BI visuals

## 📌 Conclusions & Recommendations
- Promote renewable energy adoption in high-consumption regions
- Monitor country-level energy efficiency trends
- Use data-driven insights for sustainable energy policies
- Automate data refresh for real-time monitoring
